        I have no idea how to start solving this mission
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        The general idea is to iterate over the splitted string and count only words
        with letters.

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        So, what instrument should I start with?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You need to get separate words from the string then iterate over them.
        Use string <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split">str.split()</a> method
        for the first task and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_for_loops.asp">for statement</a>
        to create loop.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
for w in words.split():
    # do_something
        </pre>

        I need some help to proceed with the mission
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        To distinguish between words and numbers, use string methods
        <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isalpha">str.isalpha()</a> and
        <a href="http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.isdigit">str.isdigit()</a>.
        For this mission one method is enough. Let's use the first one. It returns
        True if the string contains only letters. Also use Use
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/gloss_python_if_statement.asp">if statement</a>.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
if w.isalpha():
    # do_something_word
else:
    # do_something_number

        I am gone half way through. Need help!
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        You need to declare counter variable with 0 initial value before loop.
        If isalpha() for current word is True, increase counter, if False
        - you need to reset the counter, because you need to count only words in succession.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
count = 0
...
if w.isalpha():
    count += 1
    ...
else:
    count = 0

        I am stuck. I need a small hint.
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        Since you need to make this checking with each word, until the counter gets
        value 3 or no word remains, do above checking inside for loop.
        <br />
        <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
count = 0
for w in words.split():
    if w.isalpha():
        count += 1
        ...
    else:
        count = 0
...
        </pre>
    </div>

<div class="question-answer">
    <div class="question">
        What to do next?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        If your counter is already equal 3, it means there are three words in succession
        in the string and no need to proceed counting - just return True.
    <br />
    <br />
        <pre class="brush: python">
count = 0
for w in words.split():
    if w.isalpha():
        count += 1
        if count == 3:
            return True
    else:
        count = 0
        </pre>

    <div class="question">
        So, how my final solution should look like?
    </div>
    <div class="answer"> 
        if there are no word remains to check (loop ends), it means the string does
        not have three words in succession, so return False.
        Wrap the whole code in function expression.

def checkio(words: str) -> bool:

    count = 0
